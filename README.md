<!-- Informazioni sul progetto -->
## About the project
<p>The site is very simple and allows you to search through many vegetarian recipes. All recipe data are fetched by <a href='https://spoonacular.com/food-api'>Spoonacular</a> API. Therefore it is possible that the daily requests made with my key can be exhausted. In this case a section has been created in which you can insert your key.</p>
